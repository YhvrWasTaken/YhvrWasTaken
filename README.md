Heyo, I'm Yhvr.

I haven't done a lot of cool stuff yet,
but I've already made [YAML turing-complete](https://gitlab.com/yhvr/yamlcode)
and made [an incremental game people really like for some reason](https://gitlab.com/yhvr/tg-rewritten).

If you ever need to reach me, I'm available most of the time I'm awake at `Yhvr#0001` on Discord.

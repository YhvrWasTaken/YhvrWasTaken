github will soon be forcing me to enable 2fa. i can definitely set it up, but i'm lazy, and when the path of least resistance aligns with my goals, i might as well take it.

it absolutely boggles my mind that the largest repository of open-source code is itself closed source, owned by **microsoft** _(gross!)_ and is using your data to train their proprietary ai.

this will be a pain in the ass for me, because so much software that i use is hosted on github, but i simply don't care any more.

if you want to find my work in the future, visit https://yhvr.me/, https://gitlab.com/yhvr, or https://codeberg.org/yhvr.
